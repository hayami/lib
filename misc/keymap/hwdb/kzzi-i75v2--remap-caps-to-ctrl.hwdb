# Remap Caps Lock to Left Control
#   for Kzzi i75v2 Keyboard (Vendor: 3554, Product: FA09)
#
# NOTICE:
#   Pressing Control (remapped from Caps Lock) briefly lights
#   the Caps Lock LED because the keyboard turns it on and the
#   OS immediately turns it off. To resolve this, a fix on the
#   keyboard side is suspected to be required.
